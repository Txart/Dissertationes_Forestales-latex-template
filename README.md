# Dissertationes Forestales LaTeX template
I wrote this template in the preparation of my PhD thesis at the University of Eastern Finland.
I followed [these guidelines](https://www.dissertationesforestales.fi/page/authors) as closely as I could or as my patience could bear.
Hack this template at your own peril.
Kids, don't try this at home!

## Usage
The ``thesis_template.tex`` file is the main document.
Each section in the text has its own ``.tex`` file, under the ``sections`` folder.
The bibliography goes into the .bib file. (I used the Biblatex package to typeset it).

## Further info
- If you can't find some ``\usepackage{}``, that's because it's hidden in the ``DFTemplate.sty`` file.

---------------
If you are writing your PhD dissertation, I feel you.
I was there once.
All things must pass. 

(If you found this valuable, I would very much appreciate if you reached out somehow)
