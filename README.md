# Dissertationes Forestales LaTeX template
I wrote this template in the preparation of my PhD thesis at the University of Eastern Finland.
I followed [these guidelines](https://www.dissertationesforestales.fi/page/authors) as closely as I could or as my patience could bear.
Use this template at your own peril.
Kids, don't do this at home!

## Further info
If you can't find some ``\usepackage{}``, that's because it's hidden in the ``DFTemplate.sty`` file.

---------------
If you are writing your PhD dissertation, I feel you.
I was there once.
All things must pass. 

P.S.: If you found this valuable, I would very much appreciate if you reached out from your corner of the universe to mine :)
